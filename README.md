## Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper Zephyr development
environment. Follow the official
[Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (``control-ws``) where
the ``control`` application and all Zephyr modules will be cloned. Run the following
command:

```shell
# initialize my-workspace for the control application
west init -m git@github.com:toastbucket/toadly-control-fw.git --mr main control-ws
# fix clone directory name
# update Zephyr modules
cd my-workspace
west update
```

### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
cd application
west build -b atsamd21_xpro app
```

Once you have built the application, run the following command to flash it:

```shell
west flash
```

### Testing

To execute Twister integration tests, run the following command:

```shell
west twister -T tests --integration
```

### Documentation

A minimal documentation setup is provided for Doxygen and Sphinx. To build the
documentation first change to the ``doc`` folder:

```shell
cd doc
```

Before continuing, check if you have Doxygen installed. It is recommended to
use the same Doxygen version used in [CI](.github/workflows/docs.yml). To
install Sphinx, make sure you have a Python installation in place and run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

API documentation (Doxygen) can be built using the following command:

```shell
doxygen
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_doxygen`` folder. Similarly, the
Sphinx documentation (HTML) can be built using the following command:

```shell
make html
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_sphinx`` folder. You may check for
other output formats other than HTML by running ``make help``.
